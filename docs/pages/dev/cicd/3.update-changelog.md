# 💥 Update Changelog

## Overview

This GitHub Action automates the process of updating the changelog after a new release is built and published. It ensures that the changelog remains up to date with the latest changes in the repository.

## How It Works

The workflow is triggered automatically after the **Build and Publish** workflow is successfully completed.

## Workflow Configuration

### **Trigger**

- **Triggered by:**
    - Completion of `2. Build and Publish` workflow.

### **Jobs**

#### **1. Update Changelog**

This job updates the changelog after a new release.

- **Runs on:** `ubuntu-22.04`
- **Permissions:** `contents: write`
- **Steps:**
    1. **Checkout the repository** (with full history for changelog updates)
    2. **Update the changelog** using `./scripts/changelog.sh -c -p`
    3. **Commits and pushes changes** using GitHub Actions bot

## Usage

This workflow runs automatically when a new release is created. However, you can manually update the changelog by running the script locally:

```sh
./scripts/changelog.sh -c -p
```

## Environment Variables

- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Used for authentication and committing changes.

## Scripts Used

- **`changelog.sh`**: Updates the changelog file.

## Notes

- Ensure that `changelog.sh` is executable and correctly configured.
- The workflow ensures that changelog updates occur only after a successful release build.
- The changes are committed and pushed automatically to the repository.

## Troubleshooting

- If the workflow fails, ensure that `changelog.sh` is present and executable.
- If there are permissions errors, verify that GitHub Actions has the required `contents: write` permission.
- Check logs for any issues related to Git authentication or script execution.
