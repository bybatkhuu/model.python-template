# 🚀 Build and Publish

## Overview

This GitHub Action automates the process of building and publishing the project. It triggers automatically after a version bump or when a tag (`v*.*.*`) is pushed. The workflow builds the package and optionally publishes it to a package registry.

## How It Works

The workflow runs in the following scenarios:

- After **Bump Version** workflow completes.
- When a new tag (`v*.*.*`) is pushed to the repository.

## Workflow Configuration

### **Trigger**

- **Triggered by:**
    - Completion of `1. Bump Version` workflow.
    - Push event on tags matching `v*.*.*`.

### **Jobs**

#### **1. Build and Publish**

This job builds the package and creates a release.

- **Runs on:** `ubuntu-22.04`
- **Permissions:** `contents: write`
- **Steps:**
    1. **Checkout the repository**
    2. **Set up Python 3.10**
    3. **Install dependencies** (from `requirements/requirements.build.txt`)
    4. **Build the package** using `./scripts/build.sh -c`
    5. **Create a release** using GitHub CLI (`gh release create`)

## Usage

This workflow runs automatically when a new version is tagged. However, you can manually trigger a tag and push it:

1. Bump the version using the `1. Bump Version` workflow.
2. Create a tag manually and push it:

    ```sh
    git tag v1.2.3
    git push origin v1.2.3
    ```

3. The workflow will build and publish the package.

## Environment Variables

- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Used for creating GitHub releases.
- **`PYPI_API_TOKEN`** _(if enabled)_: Used for publishing packages to PyPI.

## Scripts Used

- **`build.sh`**: Builds the package.
- **`get-version.sh`**: Retrieves the current version.

## Notes

- This workflow supports both GitHub Releases and optional package publishing.
- Ensure `build.sh` is executable and correctly configured.
- If the workflow fails, check logs for errors related to dependencies or authentication.

## Troubleshooting

- If the build step fails, ensure dependencies are correctly installed.
- If release creation fails, verify that `GITHUB_TOKEN` has the necessary permissions.
- If publishing to PyPI fails, check that the API token is correctly set up in repository secrets.
